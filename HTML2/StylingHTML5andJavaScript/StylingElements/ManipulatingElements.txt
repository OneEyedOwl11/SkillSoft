Transform element translate = move an object along x and y axis rotate = rotate
an object skew you also need to use vendor prefixes for some functions e.g:
-moz-transform: rotate(90deg); //this would work for mozilla visibility
visibility: hidden; // this will hide an element but it will still take it's
space on the document opacity set transparency display can make it so the
element is not displayed on the page and there is no empty space left behind
like with visibility no user interaction when it is set to none you can still
manipulate it positioning position >>allows interaction while not affecting
layout of the page eg position: absolute; clip-path not fully supported and used
clip-path: polygon(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px,);
