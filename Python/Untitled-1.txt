Dictionaries: Allow you to have values assigned to keys
                keys are unique, values can be duplicate
                unordered collection of key valued pairs
                values looked up by keys
                values can be simple or complex data
                dictionaries are mutable

Sets: Removes duplicate values when called on and orders the values
        unordered collection of unique elements
        cannot contain other mutable types eg list and dictionaries
        can perform set operations such as union, intersection, difference

similarities:   set and dict, They are both instantiated by curly braces {} 
                dict and sets are unordered, lists are ordered
                lists can have duplicates, sets cannot and dict's cannot have duplicate keys
                lists can have nested complex data types so can dict's
                sets cannot have nested complex data types
                list elements can be looked up by index's
                sets cannot be looked up
                dicts can be looked up by keys
