Tuples and lists contain multiple values within them
correction

Ordered Collective of elements
ordering is preserved and is significant
can contain elements of different data types
index values start at 0
both can be sliced


tuples are immutable and therefore cannot be modified unlike lists
corrections

lists are in []
tuples are in ()
