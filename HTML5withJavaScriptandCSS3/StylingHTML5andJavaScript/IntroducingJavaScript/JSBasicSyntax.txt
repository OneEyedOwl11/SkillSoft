Set of rules that determine how javascript programs are created
list of processes executed by the computer and be refered to as statements
statements are separated by semi-colons ;;;;;;;;;
variables are declared using        var 
                                    e.g. var a, b, c;
                                    a = 10;
                                    b = 8;
                                    c =89;

parenthesis indicate the precedence in the statements
statements are normally composed of the following
>comments
>expressions
>Keywords
>operators
>values 

JS syntax defines two types of values
>Fixed Values 
>>can be referred to as javascript literal
>> Numbers are coded with or without decimals
>> Strings use double or single quotes

>variable values
>>referred to as variables

variables
>>Used to provision data values
>>uses var keyword to define variables
var a;
a = 100 + 10;

types of variables
>operators
>>arithmatic like -.+,*,/ to compute 
>>assignment operators (=) used to assign values to variable;

>expressions
>>combination of operators which compute to value 
>> can also contain variable value
>identifiers
>>Used to name the variables among other syntax
>>must be either 
>>>Upper camel Case =   FirstName
>>>Lower Camel Case =   firstName 
>>>Underscore =         first_name

Arrays
Variable that can contain multiple values.
ability to loop through items searching for a specific one 
e.g.
var vehicles = ["honda", "suzuki", "mazda"];
processed by index number (the first item is 0 and second is 1 so if you have 4 items in your array you'd use 0-3 to find an item)
spaces and line breaks are not necessary but best practice when troubleshooting debugging code issues
e.g.
var vehicles = [
    "Honda",
    "Mazda",
    "Subaru"
];
