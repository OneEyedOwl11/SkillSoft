Unordered lists of data types 
can also be reference data types 
Stored in a series of name-value pairs 
can be strings or numbers
each item in the series is called a property or a method
var Employee = {department:Planning", firstName:"Bob", lastName:"Smith"};
Reference data types value is stored as a reference wjile primitive data types are stored directly
object data properties have attributes which make up the series

Common ways to create objects
>object literals
                e.g. 
                var car = {
                    color: "red",
                    model: "accord",
                    make "honda",
                }
Object onstructor
>used for initializing new objects E.g.
                var car = new object();
                car.color = "red";
                car.model: "accord";
                car.make "honda";

Methods
actions performed on objects
Stored in properties as functional definitions in JS 
objectName.methodName()
    name = Employee.fullName will just call the function and not execute it you need to insert the () for it to actually run the function

definition stored as value
Built-in Methods

adding Methods are done inside the constructor function
