<h1>Children’s Literature</h1>
<p class="variation">
Most children's books are enjoyable for children and adults alike. Children are never too young to be read to. In addition to building a bond between parent and child, daily reading to preschool children may be the single most important thing parents can do to improve their children's chances for success in school.  Of course, parents should continue to read to their children after they start school and for as long as they will listen—which, if all goes well, will be throughout the elementary school years.
